# Mapping_Earthquakes

## **Overview**
This project utilizes javascript and GEOJSON data to create interactive maps to visualize earthquake data. 

### **Purpose**
The objective of this project is build interactive map visuallizations to depict the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world in the last seven days. The map allows the user to choose what to depict on the map by utilizing three datasets which depict the following:

* All earthquakes in the past seven days.
* Earthquakes with a magnitude above 4.5 in the past seven days.
* Tetonic plates in the last seven days.

## **Results**

Each earthquake is visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake has a popup marker that, when clicked, shows the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake. Furthermore, the map is modified to include a legend which depicts the color range of the earthquakes. Finally, the map has three views:

* Street View
* Staellite View
* Dark View
